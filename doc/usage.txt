Using Connector/C++ 8.0  {#usage}
=======================

Connector/C++ 8.0 implements new APIs for accessing document store of
MySQL Server 8: X DevAPI for applications written in C++11 and X DevAPI for C
for applications written in plain C. The same APIs can be also used to execute
traditional SQL queries. Connector/C++ 8.0 also implements the legacy C++ API
based on JDBC4 which is backward compatible with version 1.1 of the connector.

The choice of the API is done by including appropriate public headers.
For X DevAPI include:
~~~~~~
  #include <mysqlx/xdevapi.h>
~~~~~~
For X DevAPI for C include:
~~~~~~
  #include <mysqlx/xapi.h>
~~~~~~
And for legacy API include:
~~~~~~
  #include <jdbc/mysql_driver.h>
  #include <jdbc/mysql_connection.h>
  #include <jdbc/cppconn/*.h>
~~~~~~
The preceding include directives work under the assumption that the include path
contains `$MYSQL_CPPCONN_DIR/include`, where `$MYSQL_CPPCONN_DIR` is
the location where Connector/C++ was installed. Pass
the `-I $MYSQL_CPPCONN_DIR/include` option on the compiler invocation line
to ensure this.

@note The legacy code that uses Connector/C++ 1.1 has includes of the form
~~~~
#include <mysql_driver.h>
#include <mysql_connection.h>
#include <cppconn/*.h>
~~~~
To build such code with Connector/C++ 8 without modifying it, add
`$MYSQL_CPPCONN_DIR/include/jdbc` to the include path.


The X DevAPI uses C++11 language features. For that reason enable C++11 support
in the compiler using the `-std=c++11` option when building code that uses X DevAPI.
This is not needed for X DevAPI for C (which is a plain C API) nor for
the legacy JDBC API which is based on plain C++.


@note The legacy API requires Boost headers. The location of these headers needs
to be added to the include path to correctly compile legacy code. Only
the headers from Boost are needed -- the Boost libraries are not used during
linking phase.


Using the shared library
------------------------
Depending on the platform, the shared Connector/C++ library is named:

- `libmysqlcppconn8.so` on Unix platforms (soname `libmysqlcppconn8.so.1`)
- `libmysqlcppconn8.dylib` on the OSX platform (link name `libmysqlcppconn8.1.dylib`)
- `mysqlcppconn8-1-vsXX.dll` on Windows platforms
  (with import library vsXX/mysqlcppconn8.lib, see [Windows Notes](@ref usage_win) for more details)

This library implements the new X DevAPI and X DevAPI for C. Connector/C++ 8.0
also includes the legacy connector library `libmsysqlcppconn(.so/.dylib/.dll)`
which implements the legacy JDBC4 API.

To build code that uses new APIs, add `-lmysqlcppconn8` to the linker options
(add `-lmysqlcppconn` when building legacy code). This requires that
`$MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR/lib` or `$MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR/lib64` (the latter on a 64-bit
platform) is added to the linker path (`-L $MYSQL_CPPCONN_DIR/lib64` linker
option).

Due to ABI incompatiblities between different compiler versions, the code
that uses Connector/C++ libraries should be built with the same compiler
version as the connector itself. The information about compiler version used
to build connector libraries can be found inside `INFO_BIN` file
distributed with the connector. In principle a different version of the
compiler can be used provided that it is ABI compatible, but it is difficult to
determine which versions of the compiler are ABI compatible with each other.


An example `Makefile` to build an application which uses Connector/C++ X DevAPI,
with sources in `app.cc` is shown below:

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR= ...
CPPFLAGS = -I $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/include -L $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/lib64
LDLIBS = -lmysqlcppconn8
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11

app : app.cc
~~~~~~~

It generates the following compiler invocation:

~~~~~~~~
g++ -std=c++11 -I .../include -L .../lib64  app.cc  -lmysqlcppconn8 -o app
~~~~~~~~

@note For linking against the legacy C++ JDBC4 library the library name is
`-lmysqlcppconn`. Also, the option `-std=c++11` could be omitted unless the user
code utilizes C++11.

The connector can be also used with plain C code written against X DevAPI for C.
An example `Makefile` to build a plain C application from sources in `app.c`
might look like this:

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR= ...
CPPFLAGS = -I $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/include -L $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/lib64
LDLIBS = -lmysqlcppconn8

app : app.c
~~~~~~~

which generates the following compiler invocation:

~~~~~~~
cc  -I .../include -L .../lib64  app.c  -lmysqlcppconn8 -o app
~~~~~~~

Note that the resulting code, even though it is compiled as plain C, will
depend on the C++ runtime (`libstdc++`).


@note
When running an application which uses the shared Connector/C++ library,
the library and its runtime dependencies must be found by the dynamic linker.
The dynamic linker must be properly configured to find Connector/C++ libraries
and their dependencies.

@note
Connector/C++ libraries built by MySQL depend on OpenSSL libraries. The latter
must be installed on the system in order to run code that links against
Connector/C++ libraries. Another option is to put OpenSSL libraries in the same
location as Connector/C++. In this case the dynamic linker should find them
next to the connector library. See also [Windows Notes](@ref usage_win) and
[macOS Notes](@ref usage_macos).

@note
It is possible to build Connector/C++ libraries without OpenSSL, using internal
implementation of TLS connections. In this case the OpenSSL libraries are not
required at runtime.


Using the static library
------------------------

It is possible to link your application with the static connector library. This
way there is no runtime dependency on the connector and the resulting binary
can run on systems where Connector/C++ is not installed.

@note
However, even when linking statically, the resulting code still depends
on OpenSSL libraries and all other runtime dependencies of the Connector/C++
library.

When compiling code which is linked with the connector library statically,
define `STATIC_CONCPP` macro before including Connector/C++ public headers.
This macro adjusts API declarations in the headers for usage with
the static library.

@note For the legacy API, one defines `CPPCONN_PUBLIC_FUNC` as empty macro
instead (the same way as when using static Connector/C++ 1.1 library)

The static library names are:

- `libmysqlcppconn8-static.a` on OSX and  Unix platforms.
- `mysqlcppconn8-static.lib` on Windows platforms.

The legacy static library names are `libmysqlcppconn-static.a` and
`mysqlcppconn-static.lib`, respectively.

An example `Makefile` to build a C++ application that links to the connector
library statically is shown below:

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR= ...
CPPFLAGS = -DSTATIC_CONCPP -I $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/include
LDLIBS = $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/lib64/libmysqlcppconn8-static.a -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11

app : app.cc
~~~~~~~

It generates the following compiler invocation:

~~~~~~~
g++ -std=c++11 -DSTATIC_CONCPP -I .../include  app.cc  .../lib64/libmysqlcppconn8-static.a -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread -o app
~~~~~~~

@note For linking against the legacy C++ JDBC4 library the library name is
`-lmysqlcppconn`. Also, the option `-std=c++11` could be omitted unless the user
code utilizes C++11.

Note that we need to add to the compile line the OpenSSL libraries and
the pthread library on which Connector/C++ code depends. Otherwise linker
reports unresolved symbols.

@note
Clearly, OpenSSL libraries are not needed if Connector/C++ is built without
them. But Connector/C++ built and distributed by MySQL depends on OpenSSL.

@note
The exact list of libraries required by Connector/C++ library depends on
the platform. For example on Solaris `socket`, `rt` and `nsl` libraries might
be needed.

When building plain C code it is important to additionally take care
of connector's dependency on the C++ runtime, which is introduced by
the connector library even though the code that uses it is plain C. One approach
is to ensure that a C++ linker is used to build the final code. This approach
is taken in the example `Makefile` below:

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR= ...
CPPFLAGS = -DSTATIC_CONCPP -I $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/include
LDLIBS = $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/lib64/libmysqlcppconn8-static.a -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread
LINK.o = $(LINK.cc) # use C++ linker

app : app.o
~~~~~~~

With this `Makefile` the build process has two steps: first the application
source in `app.c` is compiled using plain C compiler, then the final executable
is linked using the C++ linker which takes care of the dependency on the
C++ runtime:

~~~~~~~
cc  -DSTATIC_CONCPP -I .../include  -c -o app.o app.c
g++  -DSTATIC_CONCPP -I .../include  app.o  .../libmysqlcppconn8-static.a -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread -o app
~~~~~~~


Another approach is to use plain C compiler and linker, but add the C++ runtime
library `libstdc++` as an explicit input to the linker:

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR= ...
CPPFLAGS = -I $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/include
LDLIBS = $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/lib64/libmysqlcppconn8-static.a -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread -lstdc++

app : app.c
~~~~~~~

With this `Makefile` the compiler is invoked as follows:

~~~~~~~
cc  -DSTATIC_CONCPP -I .../include  app.c  .../libmysqlcppconn8-static.a -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread -lstdc++ -o app
~~~~~~~

@note Even if the application that uses Connector/C++ is written in plain C, the
final executable will depend on the C++ runtime which must be installed on the
target computer on which the application will run.


macOS Notes                                              @anchor usage_macos
-----------

The binary distribution of Connector/C++ for macOS is compiled using the macOS
native `clang` compiler. For that reason an application that uses the connector
should be built with the same `clang` compiler.

The `clang` compiler can use two different implementations of the C++ runtime
library: either the native `libc++` or the GNU `libstdc++` library. It is
important that an application uses the same runtime implementation
as Connector/C++, that is, the native `libc++`. To ensure that, the
`-stdlib=libc++` option should be passed to the compiler and the linker
invocations.

An example `Makefile` for macOS build is shown below.

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR= ...
CPPFLAGS = -I $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/include -L $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/lib64
LDLIBS = -lmysqlcppconn8
CXX = clang++ -stdlib=libc++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11

app : app.cc
~~~~~~~

Binary packages for macOS include OpenSSL libraries which are required by code
linked with the connector. These libraries are installed
in the same location as the connector libraries and should be found there by
the dynamic linker.


Windows Notes                                            @anchor usage_win
-------------

On Windows applications can be built in different modes (also called build
configurations) which determine the type of the runtime library that is
used by the final executable. An application can be built in a debug or
a release mode. Then it can be built in a 32-bit or a 64-bit mode. Also, one
can choose between the static (`/MT`) or the dynamic (`/MD`) runtime. Different
versions of the MSVC compiler also use different versions of the runtime.

It is important to ensure that the compiler version and the build mode of
an application matches the same parameters used when building the connector
library. This is to ensure that the runtime library used by the connector
and the application are the same.

The binary distribution of Connector/C++ 8.0 ships libraries built in the
release mode using dynamic runtime (`/MD`). The libraries are built with
MSVC 2015 (the exact compiler version can be found in `INFO_BIN` file
included in the package). Consequently the code that uses these libraries must
be built with the same version of MSVC and in the '/MD' mode. To build your
code in different mode you must build the connector library in the same mode
first.

@note
When linking dynamically, it is possible to build your code in the debug mode
even though the connector libraries are built in the release mode. In that case
it will not be possible to step inside connector code during a debug session.
To be able to do that, or to build in debug mode while linking to the connector
statically, you must built the connector in the debug mode first (see ...).


There are separate 32-bit and 64-bit packages, each keeping libraries in
`lib/` and `lib64/` folder, respectively. Package name also contains `-vs14`
suffix to indicate that the library is built with MSVC 2015 compiler. The same
`vsNN` convention is used in library names to enable using libraries built with
different versions of MSVC on the same system.

The dynamic connector library has name `mysqlcppconn8-1-vs14.dll` with import
library `vs14/mysqlcppconn8.lib` in the `vs14/` sub-folder. This sub-folder
also contains the static version of the library `vs14/mysqlcppconn8-static.lib`.
The `1` in the dynamic library name is the major ABI version number (in the
future this will help using compatibility libraries with old ABI together with
 new libraries having a different ABI). The legacy connector library has name
`mysqlcppconn-7-vs14.dll` with import library `vs14/mysqlcppconn.lib` and
static version `vs14/mysqlcppconn-static.lib`.


When building code that uses Connector/C++ libraries add
`$MYSQL_CPPCONN_DIR/include` as additional include folder and
`$MYSQL_CPPCONN_DIR/{lib,lib64}/vs14` as additional library folder in
the project configuration. To use the dynamic library add `mysqlcppconn8.lib`
to linker inputs (`mysqlcppconn.lib` for legacy code). For static linking add
`mysqlcppconn8-static.lib` instead (`mysqlcppconn-static.lib` for legacy code).
If linking statically, the linker must find the import libraries for the required
OpenSSL libraries. They are present in the `$MYSQL_CPPCONN_DIR/{lib,lib64}/vs14`
folder if the connector was installed from the binary package provided by MySQL
and the corresponding OpenSSL DLLs are present in the main library folder, next
to the connector DLLs.


@note An application which uses the shared connector library must be able
to locate it, as well as its dependencies such as OpenSSL, at the runtime.
The common way of arranging this is to put the required DLLs in the same
location as the executable.
