Building Connector/C++ 8.0  {#building}
==========================

Prerequisites
-------------
To build Connector/C++, the following tools and libraries are required:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11. In case of gcc it must be at least
  version 4.8. These compilers have been tested: gcc 4.8.4, 4.8.5, 4.9.2, 5.4.0,
  6.3.0, 6.3.1, 7.1.1, 7.2.0, 7.2.1, clang 9.0.0, MS Visual Studio 2015.

- CMake 2.8.12 or later.

- Boost 1.59 or later if the version of the C++ standard library used does
  not implement the UTF8 converter (`codecvt_utf8`). Boost is also required
  when building the legacy connector (see below).

- OpenSSL version 1.0.x if connector is built with OpenSSL.
  Instead of OpenSSL the Connector/C++ can be build using
  WolfSSL 3.14.0 or newer.

- MySQL 8.0 client library if building the legacy connector (see below).


Build configuration
-------------------
Only out-of-source builds are supported. To configure a build, execute
`cmake` in a dedicated build location (not in the source directory):

~~~~~~~
$ cmake <Connector/C++ source location>
~~~~~~~

If Boost libraries are required and `cmake` cannot find them, specify the
correct location using the option:

- `-DWITH_BOOST=<Boost location>`

By default a shared library is built. To build a static library, use the option:

- `-DBUILD_STATIC=yes`

The build system generated by `cmake` has install target which, by default,
installs to `/usr/local/mysql/connector-c++-8.0`
(`<User home>/MySQL/"MySQL Connector C++ 8.0"` on Windows).
To change this default install location use the option:

- `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<Install location>`


Configuring SSL libraries
-------------------------
Connector/C++ can be built with different SSL libraries.
Use `-DWITH_SSL=<Option value>` to specify the desired SSL build type:

- `system`    - build with external openSSL library installed on the system, the
              library location is detected by cmake.
- `<path>`    - build with external openSSL or WolfSSL library installed at
              specified location.

@note OpenSSL notes: when Connector/C++ is configured to be built to use
      OpenSSL it will make the connector library dependent on shared OpenSSL
      libraries. When linking Connector/C++ dynamically, this dependency is
      relevant only at run time. However, when linking statically to
      the connector library the OpenSSL libraries should be explicitly
      linked too. In Linux it means adding -lssl -lcrypto to the
      compile/link command.
      In Windows this is handled automatically.

@note WolfSSL notes: Building Connector/C++ with WolfSSL library requires
      downloading the WolfSSL source package verion 3.14.0 or newer from here:
      `https://www.wolfssl.com/download/`

      `-DWITH_SSL` has to point to the directory where source files were
      unpacked. Connector/C++ will build WolfSSL libraries and link them
      statically, so no extra dependencies will be required at run time.
      Static is the only supported method of linking WolfSSL to Connector/C++.
      Dynamic linking (as with OpenSSL) is not supported.


Building and testing
--------------------
A build can be started with the following cmake invocation in the build
location:

~~~~~~~
$ cmake --build . --config CCC
~~~~~~~

where `CCC` is the build configuration to use, such as `Release` or `Debug`.
It is also possible to omit the `--config CCC` option in which case the default
`Debug` configuration will be used.

@note
  In what follows the same build configuration `CCC` must be used
  for all the steps such as installing the connector or building
  the test program.

After a successful build, the build location should contain
the Connector/C++ shared library:

- `libmysqlcppconn8.so.1` on Unix
- `libmysqlcppconn8.1.dylib` on macOS
- `CCC/mysqlcppconn8-1-vsXX.dll` on Windows, where `-vs12` or `-vs14` prefix
  depends on the MSVC version used to build the connector

The number 1 in the library name is the major ABI version of the library. It
is part of the library name so that different versions of the library can
be used at the same time on a single system.

On Unix and macOS also appropriate symbolic links are created. On Windows the
import library for the DLL is created at `CCC/mysqlcppconn8.lib` (the `CCC/`
subdirectory is named the same as the build configuration used).

In the case of a static library build, the output library names are:

- `libmysqlcppconn8-static.a` on Unix and macOS
- `CCC/mysqlcppconn8-static.lib` or `CCC/mysqlcppconn8-static-mt.lib`
  on Windows (see [Windows Notes] (@ref win_notes)).

### Testing

To perform basic testing of the connector functionality, build and run one
of the test programs included in the `testapp/` subdirectory of the source
location.

Before building test programs, Connector/C++ must be installed first. To install
Connector/C++ to the default location (which could be set during the build
configuration using `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option), execute the following
command in the build location:

~~~~~~~
$ cmake --build . --target install --config CCC
~~~~~~~

@note
  It is possible to change the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` setting before doing
  the installation. To change it, issue the following command before building
  the `install` target:
  ~~~~~~~
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<new location> .
  ~~~~~~~

To build test programs, pick a build location and issue the following
commands there:

~~~~~~~
$ cmake -DWITH_CONCPP=<Connector/C++ install location> <source location>/testapp
$ cmake --build . --config CCC
~~~~~~~

This should create the `devapi_test` and `xapi_test` executables
in the `run/` subdirectory of the build location. If testing static connector,
pass the `-DBUILD_STATIC=ON` option when configuring test applications.

@note
  On Windows, if the connector was built with the static runtime by specifying
  the `-DSTATIC_MSVCRT=yes` configuration option (see below), the same option
  must be added to the build configuration of test programs.

@note
  The 32/64-bit Windows `cmake` generator (`"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"` vs
  `"Visual Studio 14 2015"`) used to build test applications must match
  the one used to build the connector.

Before running test programs, ensure that a MySQL Server instance is running
with X Plugin loaded into it. The easiest way of arranging this is to use
the `mysql-test-run.pl` script from the MySQL Server distribution. In the
`mysql-test/` subdirectory of that distribution, invoke this command:

~~~~~~~
$ perl mysql-test-run.pl --start-and-exit --mysqld=--plugin-load=mysqlx
~~~~~~~

This should start a test server instance with X plugin loaded into it. When
started like this, the plugin will listen on port 13009 instead of
the standard 33060 one.

Now you can run one of the test programs and see the output similar to the
one presented below. Test programs accept a connection-string argument.
If the server was started as described above, run the test program with
the following connection string as a parameter:

~~~~~~~
$ run/devapi_test mysqlx://root@127.0.0.1:13009
$ run/xapi_test mysqlx://root@127.0.0.1:13009
~~~~~~~

This invocation uses the `root` user account without any password and assumes
that there is a `test` schema in the server (these assumptions hold for
a server started using `mysql-test-run.pl`).

If everything goes well, `devapi_test` should produce output similar to this:

~~~~~~~
Creating session on mysqlx://root@127.0.0.1:13009 ...
Session accepted, creating collection...

Building legacy C++ JDBC4 library                            @anchor build_jdbc
---------------------------------

Apart from the new APIs introduced in version 8.0 of the connector (X DevAPI
and X DevAPI for C), Connector/C++ also supports the legacy API based on JDBC4.
This legacy API is implemented as a separate library with base name
`mysqlcppconn` as opposed to `mysqlcppconn8` library implementing the new APIs.

To build the legacy library specify the `-DWITH_JDBC=ON` option during the cmake
configuration step. This option is disabled by default. If specified, additional
build dependencies must be satisfied:

- The MySQL 8.0 client library is needed. If `cmake` cannot find it at
  the default locations, pass the `-DMYSQL_DIR=<path_to_mysql_server_dir>` or
  the `-DMYSQL_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=<path_to_mysql_config_executable` option.

- Boost libraries are always required in this case. As explained above, use
  the `WITH_BOOST` option if `cmake` cannot find Boost at the default locations.

@note
  The code implementing the legacy connector is inside the `jdbc/` subdirectory
  of the source tree. If sources are obtained from a git repository, this
  subdirectory must be fetched separately as a git sub-module. Invoke
  `git submodule update --init` to populate the contents of the `jdbc/`
  subdirectory.


If everything goes well, after building the connector the build location
should contain an additional legacy connector library:

- `libmysqlcppconn.so.7` on Unix
- `libmysqlcppconn.7.dylib` on macOS
- `CCC/mysqlcppconn-7-vsXX.dll` on Windows

If building static libraries, the static legacy library has name:

- `libmysqlcppconn-static.a` on Unix and macOS
- `CCC/mysqlcppconn-static.lib` or `CCC/mysqlcppconn-static-mt.lib`
  on Windows


It is possible to build an additional test application `jdbc_test` for testing
the legacy connector library. To do this, pass the `-DWITH_JDBC=ON` cmake option
when configuring the build of test applications. Also, `MYSQL_DIR` or
`MYSQL_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE` and `WITH_BOOST` must be set if cmake cannot find the
required dependencies.

The connection-string argument that the `jdbc_test` application accepts must
be in the form specified by the JDBC API. The user name is passed as the second
argument. For example:

~~~~~~~
$ run/jdbc_test tcp://127.0.0.1:13009 root
~~~~~~~


Windows Notes                                                 @anchor win_notes
-------------
Connector/C++ uses the C++11 language and for that reason it is not possible
to build it with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or earlier.

On Windows one can request that Connector/C++ uses the static runtime library
(the `/MT*` compiler option) by setting the cmake option `-DSTATIC_MSVCRT=yes`.
This might be necessary if code which uses Connector/C++ also uses the static
runtime.  If building the static library in this mode, the `-mt` suffix will
be added to its name to distinguish it from a library built in `/MD` mode.

Selecting a cmake generator such as `"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"` vs
`"Visual Studio 14 2015"` selects the 64-bit or 32-bit platform for which
the connector is built. An application which uses Connector/C++ must
be built for the same platform as the connector.

An application built using 'Debug', 'Release' or other MSVC build configuration
needs to link against a Connector/C++ library built with the same configuration
(as determined by the `--config=CCC` cmake option described above). The linker
places the library built using the `CCC` configuration in a `CCC/`
subdirectory of the build location. Thus, when building an application
that uses the connector library, one has to point the linker at the location
containing a compatible build of the connector.

macOS Notes
-----------
On macOS, Connector/C++ is built using the `clang` compiler with the `libc++`
C++ runtime library. The same runtime library should be used by applications
that link against Connector/C++. To arrange this, pass `-stdlib=libc++` to
the compiler and the linker invocations. Another option is to set the required
deployment target and then the compiler defaults are changed accordingly.
To define the deployment target, set the environment variable
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to the requested OS X version. Binary distributions
of Connector/C++ are built with `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` set to `10.12`.

Building Connector/C++ with `gcc` or its `libstdc++` runtime has not been
tested and there is no support in the build system for using an alternative
C++ runtime library.
