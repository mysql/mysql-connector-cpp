/**
* Basic example of creating a stand alone program linked against Connector/C++
*
* This example is not integrated into the Connector/C++ build environment.
* You must run "make install" prior to following the build instructions
* given here.
*
* To compile the standalone example on Linux try something like:
*
* /usr/bin/c++
*   -o pthread
*   -I/usr/local/include/cppconn/
*   -Wl,-Bdynamic -lmysqlcppconn -pthread
*    examples/pthreads.cpp
*
* To run the example on Linux try something similar to:
*
*  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ ./pthread
*
* or:
*
*  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ ./pthread host user password database
*
