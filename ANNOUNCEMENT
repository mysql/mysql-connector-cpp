Dear MySQL Users,

A new GA (general availability) version of MySQL Connector/C++ has been made available: MySQL Connector/C++ 1.1.1 GA. The MySQL Connector/C++ provides a C++ API for
connecting client applications to the MySQL Server 5.1 or newer. You can download the production release at:

 http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/1.1.html

The MySQL driver for C++ offers an easy to use API derived from JDBC 4.0. MySQL Workbench is using it successfully since years. 

The major changes in 1.1.1 are;

- DatabaseMetaData::getSQLKeywords() updated to match MySQL 5.5. Note
  that C/C++, just like C/JDBC, returns the same list for every
  MySQL database version. (Ulf)

- Added MySQL_Connection::getLastStatementInfo() which returns back the
  value of the mysql_info() function of libmysql / Connector/C. (Andrey)

- Added new method ResultSetMetaData::isNumeric() and implemented it in
  all classes that subclass from it. (Andrey)

- Fixed the bug causing compilation errors in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 if
  stdint.h was included. See http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=60307

- Fixed bug making statement that did not raise any warning to return
  warnings from previously executed statement.

- Fixed stores(Lower|Mixed)Case(Quoted)Identifiers methods.

- URI format has been extended to better fit IPv6 addresses. You now can use [] to separate hohst part of the uri.

- Built against libmysql 5.5.27 enabling support of authentification plugins
  and IPv6.
