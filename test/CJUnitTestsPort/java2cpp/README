Usage:
[perl] java2cpp.pl [-auto=<autoAnswer>] <javaClassFileName>

<autoAnswer> is one of a, c, d, s. I would say that only "a" and "c" make sense
to use there.

I usually use it as:

java2cpp.pl -auto=a <javaClassFileName> 2> traceLog

And then watch result in editor and do changes in dictionary file amd/or script.
"a" means "as is" and leaves all unknown words as is ("c" would comment them out;
not really useful either). Without "-auto=a" work of script will be long and boring.

Script does many assumptions on Marks's code style. Sometimes they are wrong.
Also there are couple of known bugs =)
